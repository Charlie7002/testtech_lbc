# Test Technique Charlotte Cachet

Dev depencencies added :

-  axios / Personal preference for fetch data from api
-  react-icons / Icons for the app

I use the hook useState to manage the global state.
I think Redux is overkill for this project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run start-server`

Launches the server in the background.\
